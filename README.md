## Result

![Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c126cd25-6232-4ff1-9b03-06d7e3b62a10)


Key findings include a relatively high attrition rate of 17.31%, with R&D and Sales identified as departments with significant attrition. The dashboard also highlights a concentration of employees in the 25-34 age group and varying levels of job satisfaction across different roles. To address these issues, I recommend implementing strategies to improve retention in R&D and Sales, investigating factors contributing to high attrition in Life Sciences, enhancing job satisfaction through surveys and initiatives, and reviewing and updating HR policies to address identified concerns. This HR Analytics Dashboard empowers HR professionals to make data-driven decisions and improve employee retention and satisfaction within the organization.
